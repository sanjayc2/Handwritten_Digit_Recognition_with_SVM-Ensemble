# MNIST-w-SVM---High-Accuracy
Jupyter notebook running SVM (RBF kernel) w/ data augmentation (using scipy's ndimage) to classify handwritten digits. A OneVsRest classifier were used to allow multi-class classification and a Bagging classifier was added to improve generalization. Validation was used for hyperparameter tuning. High accuracy (~98%) was achieved on the test set.
